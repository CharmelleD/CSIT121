<h1>Djèwo Recipe</h1>
<h2>What is Djèwo?</h2>
My name is Charmelle, and on this website, I will share with you my favority dish, Djèwo. Djèwo, also called Amiwo is a traditional, and very popular, dish from my home country, Benin in west Africa. It is a very tasty food, which has the consistency of dough, and which I grew up eating mainly on special occasions. It is a dish generally cooked and served with grilled chicken. My mom taught me how to cook Djèwo as it is normally served, but when I became pescatarian, I came up with my own twist of the recipe.
